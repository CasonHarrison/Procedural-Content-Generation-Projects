# UnityShaderProjects
Included in this repo are the asset files and project settings of my unity shader work. Shader files can be found under respective folder under assets. Topics range from procedural mesh generation, to rendering, and more! Most of these projects were made using untiy version  2022.3.43 (f1) and the built-in 3D rendering pipeline. To demo any of these shaders, download unity 2022.3.43(f1) here https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive and import the assests and projectSettings
